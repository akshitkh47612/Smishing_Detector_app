# Smishing_Detector_app
There are apps like truecaller who categorize spam sms according to user's spam report and
on basis of suspicious keyword. Like in this below gure someone got a proper job oer
but on the basis of the word "Congratulations!" (sometimes used in smishing) the truecaller
blocked. But there is no option URL based blocking.

Using this android application, an user can get a basic knowledge of phishing, It will have a feature to check URLs. And also will have an option to report directly on cybercrime.gov.in.
